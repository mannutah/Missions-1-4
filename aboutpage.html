        Hi my name is Utah Mann, with over 5 years experience in the fitness industry, working with and training people from ALL OVER THE WORLD! I know what it takes to transform your body, mind, and life to accomplish anything you set out to. 
    
        My fitness journey began when me and a good friend decided that our passion for fitness went beyond our obsession with training, but was something we could use to help and better others. Plus it was paying much more than our current gigs. 
    
        From being a fitness coach at OrangeTheory Fitness in the United States & New Zealand, to becoming a Personal Trainer at one of the worlds most luxurious fitness brands ‘Equinox’, I’ve met with, trained, and have been trained by so many wise, wonderful, and inspirational people. I’ve helped clients reach sports scholarships, loose weight, gain muscle, feel more confident, transform their bodies, change their health, and so much more. 
    
        From it all i have learned this very important lesson, “The only way to serve the masses, is by doing so, one at a time.”
    
        Let me serve you, lets beginning your tomorrow, today!</b>
